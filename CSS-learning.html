            <h3>Hover Effects</h3>
            <p>
              In this section, I explored using CSS to create dynamic visuals
              with hover effects. I applied a specific background to a div
              element, giving it a unique appearance by setting properties like
              background-image, background-size, and background-position for
              customization. To add interactivity, I used the :hover
              pseudo-class to change the background to a playful GIF when the
              user hovers over the div. This effect adds a bit of surprise and
              humor, showing how CSS can be used to make web content more
              engaging and interactive for users. The hover effect also
              highlights the versatility of CSS, allowing for creative styling
              that responds to user actions.

            <h3>Box-Model</h3>
            <p>
              The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design,
              representing how elements are structured and spaced on a page.
              Each HTML element is essentially a "box," which consists of four
              key areas: content, padding, border, and margin. The content area
              holds the actual text or image. Surrounding the content is the
              padding, which provides space between the content and the border,
              creating "breathing room" within the element itself. The border
              wraps around the padding and content, often used to define the
              visual boundary of an element. Finally, the margin is the
              outermost layer, adding space between the element and neighboring
              elements. Understanding the box model is essential for effective
              layout control, as it helps in creating well-organized and
              visually appealing designs by managing the spacing and sizing of
              elements precisely.

              <h3>Flexbox</h3>
              <p>
                In this section, I explored Flexbox, a powerful CSS layout
                model. Flexbox allows for precise alignment and distribution of
                items within a container. By setting the container's display
                property to
                <code>flex</code>, elements can be aligned horizontally or
                vertically, spaced evenly, or centered with ease. For example,
                the items in the box above are aligned using properties like
                <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>. This
                layout model makes it simpler to build responsive designs.

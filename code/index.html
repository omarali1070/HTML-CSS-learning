          <p>
            In HTML, images are embedded using the img tag, which requires the
            src attribute to define the images file path. Additionally, the alt
            attribute provides a text description of the image for accessibility
            purposes, ensuring that visually impaired users can understand the
            content. CSS can be used to style images, including controlling
            their size, positioning, and borders. For example, properties like
            width, height, and border-radius can make images responsive and
            visually appealing. To make images responsive, CSS properties such
            as max-width: 100% can be applied, ensuring the image scales
            according to the container's size without distorting its aspect
            ratio. This is particularly useful in responsive web design, where
            images need to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
            In HTML, tables are created using the table element, with rows
            defined by tr (table row) and columns within those rows specified by
            td (table data). The th element is used for header cells, which are
            typically bold and centered by default. CSS plays a crucial role in
            styling tables, enabling customization of borders, spacing, text
            alignment, and colors. For instance, the border-collapse property
            can be used to make table borders collapse into a single border,
            creating a cleaner look. Additionally, CSS can help improve table
            readability by alternating row colors with the :nth-child selector
            or by adjusting the width and height of columns using the width and
            height properties. Tables are also made more responsive using
            techniques such as max-width: 100% to ensure they fit within the
            available space on different devices, especially when viewed on
            smaller screens.

          <p>
            In HTML, forms are created using the form element, which contains
            various input fields that allow users to submit data. Common form
            elements include input, textarea, select, and button. Each input
            field is associated with a name attribute, which is used to identify
            the data when the form is submitted. The action attribute specifies
            the destination URL where the form data will be sent, and the method
            attribute determines how the data is sent (e.g., GET or POST). CSS
            is essential for styling forms, ensuring they are visually appealing
            and user-friendly. Properties like padding, margin, and border can
            be applied to input fields to make them more comfortable to interact
            with. CSS can also help with layout, positioning, and customizing
            the appearance of buttons and labels. To make forms more accessible
            and responsive, media queries and flexible grid systems can be used,
            ensuring the form adapts to different screen sizes and remains easy
            to navigate on any device.

         <div>
          <div class="circle" id="round"></div>
         </div>          
         <p>
            To create a circle using HTML and CSS, I used a div element, which
            is a block-level container. By applying CSS, I transformed this div
            into a circle. First, I set the width and height properties to equal
            values (e.g., 100px by 100px) to ensure the shape is perfectly
            round. The border-radius property was then set to 50%, which rounds
            the corners of the div, turning it into a circle. To center the
            circle on the page, I used a combination of CSS properties. One
            common approach is to set the containers display property to flex
            and use justify-content: center and align-items: center to
            horizontally and vertically center the circle within the parent
            container. Additionally, I applied height: 100vh to the parent
            container to ensure it occupies the full height of the viewport,
            making the circle stay centered regardless of the screen size.
